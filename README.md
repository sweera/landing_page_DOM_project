# Landing Page

### A brief Summary

The basic HTML/CSS structure of the multi-section website was provided by Udacity. I used that and modified it according to my liking and comfort. 
The task was to add functionality using Javascript as the lesson preceding it was about DOM Manipulation. 

### Technologies Used

- HTML5/CSS3
- Vanilla Javascript
- Visual Studio Code
- Git Version Control

### Features of DOM Manipulation

- A menubar that was added dynamically as an unordered list. When user clicks on a menu item, the page scrolls to that section
- When the user is scrolling the page, the section that they stay on gets subsequently highlighted in the menubar
- The code is responsive and compatible for smaller screens as well
- A 'scroll to top' button at the bottom to take user directly to the top of the page instead of scrolling.
- The menubar disappears when user scrolls down providing full view screen to the section being viewed.
