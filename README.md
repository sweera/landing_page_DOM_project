# landing_page_udacity
<h1>Landing Page</h1>
<p>This project is a part of a Nanodegree Program for Front End Development that I am currently pursuing on Udacity.</p>

<h3>A brief Summary</h3>
<p>The basic HTML/CSS structure of the multi-section website was provided by Udacity. I used that and modified it according to my liking and comfort. 
The task was to add functionality using Javascript as the lesson preceding it was about DOM Manipulation. </p>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li>HTML5/CSS3</li>
  <li>Vanilla Javascript</li>
  <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
  <li>Git Version Control</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features of DOM Manipulation </h3>
<ul>
  <li>A menubar that was added dynamically as an unordered list. When user clicks on a menu item, the page scrolls to that section</li>
  <li>When the user is scrolling the page, the section that they stay on gets subsequently highlighted in the menubar</li>
  <li>The code is responsive and compatible for smaller screens as well</li>
  <li>A 'scroll to top' button at the bottom to take user directly to the top of the page instead of scrolling.</li>
  <li>The menubar disappears when user scrolls down providing full view screen to the section being viewed.</li>
</ul>
